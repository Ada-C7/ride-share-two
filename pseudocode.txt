Trip CLASS

  Each trip should be INSTANTIATED (initialize) with an ID, rider ID, driver ID, date, rating (each rating should be within an acceptable range 1-5)
    input: Trip.new
    output: new Trip object w/ applicable ratings

  Retrieve associated driver instance through driver ID
    input: Driver ID
    output: Driver Object associated w/ trip

  Retrieve associated Rider instance through Rider ID
    input: Rider ID
    output: Rider object associated w/ trip

  Find all trip instances (driver) CLASS METHOD
    input: Driver ID
    output: list (ARRAY) of all trip instances for that Driver

  Find all trip instances (rider) CLASS METHOD
    input: Rider ID
    output: list (ARRAY) of all trip instances for that Rider

  Retrieve all trips from CSV file CLASS METHOD
    input: calling Class method Trips.find_all
    output: list all trips from CSV file.

Driver CLASS

  Each driver should be INSTANTIATED (initialize) with an ID, name and VIN (VIN must be specific length to make sure it is actually a vin)
    input: Driver.new
    output: new instance of Driver with associated ID, Name and VIN.  Each of those should be ACCESSIBLE (attr_reader)

  with Driver ID we need to retrieve a list of trip instances (objects class: trip) that only this driver has taken.
    input: Driver ID
    output: ARRAY of Trips that this driver has taken

  retrieve an average rating for that driver based on all trips taken.
    input: ARRAY of trips that this driver has taken
    output: Average star rating FIXNUM

  Retrieve all drivers from the CSV file
    input: calling the CLASS METHOD
    output: list of all drivers (ARRAY) from CSV file

  Find a specific driver using numeric ID
    input: Numeric Driver_ID
    output: Specific driver from list of drivers.


Riders CLASS

  Each rider should be instantiated (INITIALIZE) with an ID, name and phone number
    input: Rider.new
    output: new rider object.

  Retrieve a list of trips only this rider has taken
    input: Rider ID
    output: Array of Trip instances

  Retrieve a list of all previous driver instances this rider has rode with.
    input: Array of Trip instances (from above)
    output: Array of the associated drivers.

  Retrieve all riders from CSV file
    input: calling CLASS METHOD
    output: list of all RIDERS

  Retrieve specific rider using numeric ID
    input: Rider ID
    output: Specific rider (from list above)
